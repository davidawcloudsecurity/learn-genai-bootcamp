By the end of the 65‑hour Generative AI Bootcamp video, you’ll be able to design, build, and deploy practical GenAI applications (web backends, frontends, and microservices) that use modern LLMs and multimodal models, with a concrete portfolio built around language‑learning tools for a Japanese school. You will move from fundamentals (Python, data, prompt engineering, model usage) to intermediate skills like agents, APIs, security, and deployment in the cloud.[2][4][6]

## Core concepts and tools

- You learn generative AI foundations, including how LLMs like GPT, Claude, Gemini and Meta models work, along with concepts like prompt engineering, model fine‑tuning, and GenAI solution architecture.[4][6][2]
- You get hands‑on with Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and data libraries as the base for building and experimenting with AI applications.[2][4]

## Application and project skills

- The course centers on building a suite of AI‑powered apps for a Japanese Language Learning School: sentence constructors, vocabulary tools, listening and comprehension apps, and even a visual‑novel‑style learning experience.[6][4]
- You also work through additional applied projects such as ASL finger‑spelling, Kana writing practice, and PR review generation, which reinforce how to adapt GenAI patterns to different domains.[6]

## Backend, frontend, and cloud

- You learn to design and implement backend APIs: writing tech specs, defining JSON schemas and tasks, implementing and testing backend code, and wiring it into frontends.[4][6]
- You cover frontend implementation (with instructors Kristi and Matt) and connect it to AI backends, plus deploy components using services like AWS Lambda and containerized microservices.[4][6]

## Agents, microservices, and tooling

- You explore agents and structured JSON output, building agentic workflows with components like OPEA mega‑services, TTS microservices, and troubleshooting AI pipelines (e.g., GPT‑SoVits, vLLM attempts).[6][4]
- You work with tools and frameworks such as DeepSeek in Lambda, Ollama comparisons, WhisperX for word‑by‑word transcription, and multimodal generation tools like OmniGen and visual‑novel pipelines.[4][6]

## Security, ethics, and career skills

- The bootcamp includes dedicated sessions on GenAI security, common AI security mistakes, and responsible AI practices for real‑world deployments.[6][4]
- Through fireside chats and “How top companies deploy AI” segments, you gain insight into applied AI engineering roles, govtech use cases, and how to present your final project submissions as a portfolio for jobs or freelance work.[2][4][6]

If you share your current level (no‑code, beginner Python, or experienced dev), a tailored “what to focus on first” path through the timestamps can be outlined.
